## Abstract

1. "timed elastic band" considers temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints, a trajectory with explicit dependence on time
2.  formulated in a weighted multi-objective optimization framework
3. Most objectives are local, a sparse system matrix

## Introduction

In the context of motion planning this paper focuses on local path modification assuming that an initial path has been generated by a global planner. Our approach, called "timed elastic band" is novel as it explicitly augments "elastic band" with temporal information, thus allowing the consideration of the robotâ€™s **dynamic constraints** and direct **modification of trajectories rather than path**s.

The objective of a fastest path is easily achieved by minimizing the square of the sum of all time differences. This objective leads to a fastest path in which the intermediate configurations are uniformly separated in time rather than space.


$$
f_k=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \Delta T_i\right)^2

STEP1: an initial path is enhanced to an initial trajectory by adding default timing information respecting the dynamic and kinematic constraints

STEP2: dynamically adds new configurations or deletes previous ones in order to adjust the spatial and temporal resolution to the **remaining** trajectory length or planning horizon

STEP3: The optimization problem is transformed into a **hyper-graph** that has configurations and time differences as nodes. They are connected with edges representing given objective functions or constraint functions

STEP4:  solved with large scale optimization algorithms for **sparse systems** which are contained in the "g2o-framework"

STEP5: Before every new iteration, the re-initialization phase checks new and changing way-points which can be useful if way-points are received after analyzing shortrange camera or laser-scan data
