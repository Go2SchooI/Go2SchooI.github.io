I am a senior student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Engineering University. 

I participated in the RoboMaster University Championship for three years, focusing on the development of **Auto Aiming System** and **Autonomous Mobile Robots**. Some of the effects are shown in the gallery page. Now I'm working on **Cable-Driven Manipulator**. Due to the competitive requirements of the competition, I have only open-sourced part of my work in the Github repository, **sentry-gimbal** and **sentry-chassis**, respectively. I've been building this personal page since October 2023 to document the learning process, and I'll be adding to it as I see fit with the importance of what's been written prior to that point.

I am looking for **PhD/MPhil/RA** opportunities and my areas of interest include **Autonomous Driving**, **Robotics** and **Optimal Control**. For a more detailed description of me, please see my CV.
