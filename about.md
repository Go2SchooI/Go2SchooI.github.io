Hi! Thank you for visiting my page! I am a senior student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Engineering University. 

I participated in the RoboMaster University Championship for three years, focusing on the development of **Auto Aiming System** and **Autonomous Mobile Robots**. Some of the effects are shown in the **Gallery** page. Due to the competitive requirements of the competition, I only open-sourced part of my work in the Github repository, [**sentry-gimbal**](https://github.com/Go2SchooI/sentry_gimbal_public) and [**sentry-chassis**](https://github.com/Go2SchooI/sentry_chassis_public), respectively. 

Now I'm working on **7-DOF Cable-Driven Manipulator** and details of this project can be found in the Cable Driven Manipulator series in the **Blog** page.

I am looking for **PhD/MPhil/RA** opportunities and my areas of interest include **Robotics**, **Autonomous Driving** and **Optimal Control**. For more detailed information, please see my [resum√©](https://go2schooi.github.io/Jizexian_CV.pdf).
