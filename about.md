I am a senior student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Engineering University. 

I participated in the RoboMaster University Championship for three years, focusing on the development of **Auto Aiming System** and **Autonomous Mobile Robots**. Some of the effects are shown in the Gallery page. Due to the competitive requirements of the competition, I have only open-sourced part of my work in the Github repository, [**sentry-gimbal**](https://github.com/Go2SchooI/sentry_gimbal_public) and [**sentry-chassis**](https://github.com/Go2SchooI/sentry_chassis_public), respectively. Now I'm working on **Cable-Driven Manipulator** and details of this project can be found in the Cable Driven Manipulator series in the Blog.

I've been building this personal page since October 2023 to document learning process for my next stage, and I'll be adding to it as I see fit with the importance of what's been written prior to that point.

I am looking for **PhD/MPhil/RA** opportunities and my areas of interest include **Autonomous Driving**, **Robotics** and **Optimal Control**. For more detailed information, please see my [CV](https://go2schooi.github.io/Jizexian_CV.pdf).
