I am a senior student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Harbin Engineering University. 

I participated in the RoboMaster University Championship for three years, focusing on the development of **auto aiming system** and **autonomous mobile robots**. Now I'm working on **cable-driven manipulator**.

I am looking for phd/mphil/RA opportunities and my areas of interest include autonomous driving, optimal control and robotics engineering.
